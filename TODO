Ok I need to prioritize what I am working on. This will be an ordered list.

- Fix sweep, ask for position should be at the same time of take picture, otherwise the arm has moved...
- Sweep
- Lumiere pour eclairer ce que la camera voit
- Pince Ã©tau
- See live camera
- Instead of saying error received command when already doing one, simply keep the char in memory.... char pendingChar = cmd; if (!pendingChar......)
- Balance
- Axe vertical
- Simulation 3d
